# Abstract

We propose leveraging WebAuthn signatures as an alternative to ED25519
signatures for creating passwordless accounts and approving transactions
processed through Chainweb Node and Pact smart contracts.

# Motivation

The current user experience for creating an account and signing transactions can
be challenging for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology:

- The concept of public / private keypairs is not widely understood.
- Wallets often generate a 12-24 word mnemonic phrase that users need to store
  securely in addition to a traditional password.

Moreover, the security of accounts generated through many existing wallets is
centralized because the user's key pairs are generated and stored by the wallet
provider. If the wallet provider becomes unavailable or is compromised, users
may lose access to their assets.

WebAuthn enables users to securely generate and store key pairs directly on
their own hardware devices. These key pairs can typically be accessed via Touch
ID or Face ID, allowing users to log in and sign transactions without passwords.
Since the private key never leaves the user's hardware device and no password
needs to be securely stored, this method enhances security. Additionally, using
WebAuthn key pairs provides a user-friendly and convenient experience similar to
services like Apple Pay or Google Pay.

# Specifications

## Webauthn Pact Keysets

The WebAuthn public key that we provide to Chainweb Node is composed of a JSON
Web Key (JWK) that has been base64 encoded and prefixed with `WEBAUTHN-`. The
prefix indicates that different validation needs to be applied in Chainweb Node
and Pact. This, however, should not impact any smart contracts as WebAuthn
public keys are accepted as part of any keyset in Pact.

```pact
(env-data
  { 'ks :
    { 'keys :
    ["WEBAUTHN-a50102032620012158206fb822acf87bea4a37c2d5ff067675456bd38afc4f3d43afd0c7d2c94cd997d6225820c464ff1bccf536172dea9eb37ae3bbfc411bf129afda751ea2f7faace4dbf9c8"]
    , 'pred : 'keys-all
    }
  }
)
(enforce-keyset (read-keyset 'ks))
```

### WebAuthn Public Key

The JWK used to compose the public key for Pact keysets can be generated using
the
[Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)
on the browser using specific
[configuration options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create#publickey_object_structure)
to create an "account".

Notes about specific configuration options:

- `challenge`: When creating new credentials, a `challenge` will be requested by
  the Web Authentication API. Since we are only trying to retrieve the JWK and
  don't need to sign anything, the challenge value is arbitrary so we can
  provide any value that satisfies the API.
- `pubKeyCredParams`: Currently Chainweb Node only supports the `ES256`
  encryption algorithm. This is represented by the algorithm value `-7`
- `user`: The user requires an `id` which needs to be unique for every account.
  If a new account is created using the same `id` as an existing account, the
  former account will be overwritten and lost. It is best to ensure that this
  `id` is unique, otherwise you may not be able to access assets guarded by the
  Pact keyset derived from the lost account.
- `rp`: rp stands for `relying party` and will default to the document origin
  when it is omitted. This is provided because webauthn keys are always tied to
  a specific domain and cannot be used with any other domains

```js
var publicKeyConfig = {
  challenge: Uint8Array.from("arbitrary-string"),

  // Relying Party:
  rp: {
    name: 'Kadena WebAuthN Wallet',
    id: window.location.hostname, // defaults to the document origin when omitted
  },

  user: {
    id: Uint8Array.from("Alex Müller" + Date.now())
    name: 'alex.mueller@example.com',
    displayName: 'Alex Müller',
  },

  // This Relying Party will accept an ES256 credential
  pubKeyCredParams: [
    {
      type: 'public-key',
      alg: -7, // "ES256" as registered in the IANA COSE Algorithms registry
    },
  ],

  authenticatorSelection: {
    // Try to use UV if possible. This is also the default.
    userVerification: 'preferred',
  },

  timeout: 60000, // 1 minute

  attestation: "direct" // Retrieves the attestation statement as generated by the authenticator
};
```

## Chainweb Node Requests

When using WebAuthn to sign for transactions, Chainweb Node requires some
additional information to validate signatures.

> In the below json schema's the new or updated attributes are prefixed with a
> `+`.

### Sigs Payload

`ED25519` signatures are generated by signing the transaction `hash` using the
private key which Chainweb Node can validate using the public key.

When using WebAuthn signatures, the authenticator (the hardware device used to
generate the keyset and sign for transactions) will sign a message constructed
using `athenticatorData` and `clientDataJSON`. In order to validate the
signature, this data will need to be provided along with the signature to
Chainweb Node.

```json
{
  "cmd": string,
  "hash": string,
  "sigs": [
    {
      "sig": string,
+     "authenticatorData": string,
+     "clientDataJSON": string,
    }
  ]
}
```

### Command Payload

In the command payload the `signers` array provides information about the public
key(s) that will be signing the request. The `scheme` should indicate that the
signature will be provided via `WebAuthn`.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "exec": {
      "code": string,
      "data": json
    },
  },
  "meta": {
    "chainId": string,
    "creationTime": number,
    "gasLimit": number,
    "gasPrice": number,
    "sender": string,
    "ttl": number
  },
  "networkId": string,
  "nonce": string,
  "signers": [{
    "clist": [{
      "name": string,
      "args": [string|number]
    }],
+   "pubKey": string,
+   "scheme": "ED25519" | "WebAuthn"
  }]
}
```

## WebAuthn Smart Contracts

In order to manage accounts guarded by a `WebAuthn` key, two new smart contracts
will be introduced: `webauthn-guard` and `webauthn-wallet`.

This approach creates a thin layer of abstraction over the keysets, enabling an
account to have multiple devices associated with it. As a result, an account is
not restricted to the devices known at the time of registration, but retains the
flexibility to add new devices or replace existing ones.

### WebAuthn Guard Smart Contract

The `webauthn-guard` contract handles account management and authorization. It
keeps track of all the keysets associated with an account and allows users to
configure how many keysets need to sign for authorization and additional keyset
registration requests.

> This account architecture takes inspiration from how keysets work in Pact. For
> example, a webauthn guard is like a multi-key keyset with a min approval
> predicate, however it allows for adding additional keys in retrospect and
> there can be custom min approval requirements for adding new keys.

The following is a snippet of the account schema from `webauthn-guard`:

```pact
(defschema device-schema
  name          : string
  domain        : string
  credential-id : string
  guard         : guard
)

(defschema account-schema
  @model [
    (invariant (> (length devices) 0))
    (invariant (< (length devices) 5))
    (invariant (> min-approvals 0))
    (invariant (> min-registration-approvals 0))
    (invariant (<= min-approvals (length devices)))
    (invariant (<= min-registration-approvals (length devices)))
  ]
  devices                    : [object{device-schema}]
  min-approvals              : integer
  min-registration-approvals : integer
)
```

> Note: `device` refers to a webauthn keyset in this context, however any keyset
> can be used as a `device`. (I think we should update it to keyset?)

The `id` for each `webauthn-guard` account is derived from the principal of the
keyset used to create the account. When the principal is created from the
keyset, Pact identifies the keyset as being of the WebAuthn type and generates a
`w:account`. Given the uniqueness of all WebAuthn keysets, only the person with
access to the initial keyset can recreate the same `w:account` across other
chains.

If the first device is lost, the user can utilize a `copy` function, which
executes a defpact to transfer the current `account-schema` to a new chain. This
process functions like a new registration, requiring the user to meet the
`min-registration-approval` criteria.

#### Registering an existing account with a new wallet

Accounts created with the `webauthn-guard` contract can be accessed through
multiple wallets. Although WebAuthn keysets are domain-specific (i.e., users can
only sign transactions with the keysets generated on their original wallet),
additional keysets from another wallet can be added if the registration
requirements are met with the original wallet's keysets. This provides users
with greater flexibility in choosing wallets and reduces dependence on any
single wallet.

### WebAuthn Wallet Smart Contract

The `webauthn-wallet` contract is designed to facilitate the integration of
webauthn-guard accounts with existing `fungible-v2` contracts.

To create a `fungible-v2` account, you need to provide an account name and a
guard. Since Pact accepts capabilities as guards, `webauthn-wallet` performs the
following steps:

- Creates a capability guard using the `w:account` from `webauthn-guard`
- Uses the `c:account` as the guard for the `fungible-v2` account

By employing a capability guard, we inherit the account properties of a
`webauthn-guard` account while also enforcing its requirements to secure the
`fungible-v2` account.

#### Account Management

Each account has a `w:account` and a `c:account`. To simplify account
management, `webauthn-wallet` wraps some functions, allowing users to only track
their `c:account`. The following functions from `webauthn-guard` are wrapped by
`webauthn-wallet`:

- add-device
- remove-device
- copy-account

#### WebAuthn Wallet Capabilities

Since `fungible-v2` accounts are guarded by a capability, transactions requiring
authentication must bring the `webauthn-wallet.DEBIT` capability into scope.

Most contracts should be written with `webauthn-guard` and `webauthn-wallet` in
mind. However, the `coin` contract, being non-upgradable, will likely not
accommodate `webauthn-wallet` accounts. As a result, you cannot bring the
`webauthn-wallet.DEBIT` capability into scope when using native `coin`
functions/capabilities. To address this, the `webauthn-wallet` contract provides
the following functions/capabilities as alternatives to their `coin`
counterparts:

- `coin.transfer` _(function)_ -> `webauthn-wallet.transfer`
- `coin.GAS` _(capability)_ -> `webauthn-wallet.GAS_PAYER`
- `coin.TRANSFER` _(capability)_ -> `webauthn-wallet.TRANSFER`
